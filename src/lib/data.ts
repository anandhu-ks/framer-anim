export const intro = `I’m a frontend superhero, swooping in to save the day with my
coding skills! My mission? To make the web a better place, one
clean line of code at a time. I don’t just settle for pretty UIs;
my vision is to craft dynamic user experiences that are as smooth
as a superhero landing. Armed with modern web technologies, I
build responsive web applications that look great and work even
better. I tackle complex problems with a smile, writing
maintainable code that even my computer gives a thumbs-up to.
Together, let’s create something amazing and keep the web fun and
functional!`;
